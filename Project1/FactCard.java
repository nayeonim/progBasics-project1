	 * - String values for the question (a keyword for the fact) and answer (the fact itself)
	 * - and a position x and y, indicating where on a canvas the card is located.
	 * 
	 * When the FactCard is initially constructed, 
	 * - it is NOT flipped to show the keyword (i.e. is revealing the Question, not the Answer), 
	 * - its dimension is set to the given factCardDimension value,
	 * - its integer key is initialized to the given value, and
	 *      - its question/answer String values are initialized automatically, depending on the given integer key
	 *      - its positions X and Y are calculated and set automatically using the given dimension and spacing information, 
	 *        depending on the integer key of the card.

	 * @param key the key of the FactCard to be constructed (used for identification of card and calculation of other fields)
